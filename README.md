# 💪 My Personal Health Assistant – React Native App

## 🧠 Vision

Build a **smart health assistant** that helps people (including myself) understand and optimize their **blood sugar levels** by tracking key lifestyle data like workouts, food, steps, sleep, and more.

The ultimate goal:  
**Feed an AI with as much personal context as possible** so it can explain why your blood sugar behaves a certain way — and how to improve it.

---

## 🔥 Why This Matters

Current health apps are:

- Too generic.
- Limited in data ownership.
- Hard to customize.
- Not built with **diabetic insight + fitness context** in mind.

This app is:

- **Fully customizable**.
- **Data-centric** — you own your health records.
- Designed for **maximum insight**, not minimum features.
- A real assistant, not a dumb tracker.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (with potential future AI/ML layer)

## 🛠️ Current Focus: Workout Module

Start small. Start smart. First module:

### 🏋️ Workout Logging

- Log exercises, sets, reps, weights, RPE.
- Track gym sessions with timestamps.
- Export/share workouts.
- Optional: estimate calories burned, tag body parts, etc.
- Fully offline with optional cloud sync later.

Why?

> Because I already workout, I already log it in messy notes, and I’m sick of using apps that don’t give me full control over the data I care about.

---

## 🧱 Future Modules (Expandable Design)

- 🍽️ Food tracking (basic at first, then barcode/NLP)
- 🩺 Blood glucose logs (manual + synced from CGMs later)
- 🛌 Sleep tracking
- 🚶‍♂️ Step/activity tracking
- 😌 Mood/stress logs
- 💬 AI assistant to analyze correlations

---

## ✅ MVP Plan

1. [ ] Workout logging screen
2. [ ] Store data locally (SQLite or backend sync)
3. [ ] Clean data models for exercise/session logs
4. [ ] Basic stats (e.g. total volume, max weight)
5. [ ] Then: move to glucose logging

## 💡 Reminder to Myself

> You're building this because you're tired of messy notes, apps that don’t “get” you, and advice that ignores your real life.  
> This is **your tool**, **your data**, **your health** — and if you make it work for yourself, you’ll make it work for others too.

## ✨ Motivation Tip

When you don’t feel like building the blood sugar stuff, **build what excites you**.  
You’re not off-track — you’re just building momentum.
